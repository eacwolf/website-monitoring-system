 Website Uptime & Ping Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Website uptime and ping monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana provides a powerful, open-source solution to ensure your web services are always available and performing well. By integrating Blackbox Exporter, Prometheus can probe external endpoints over HTTP(S), TCP, and ICMP, collecting metrics like response time, HTTP status codes, and SSL expiry. These metrics are stored in Prometheus and visualized through Grafana dashboards, enabling real-time monitoring and historical analysis.

This setup allows you to:

Monitor multiple websites or APIs for availability and latency

Visualize success rates, response durations, and HTTP statuses

Detect outages or performance degradation early

Set up alerts using Prometheus Alertmanager for automatic notifications

It's an efficient, scalable, and fully customizable monitoring stack ideal for developers, SREs, and system admins.
